### To give you an introduction to Kafka. A key ingredient in Big Data systems.
### For those project groups who are looking to expand their projects and learn about Kafka - this is your chance to learn from this example and use in your projects. Optional of course.
### Etiquette:
### Please do not share the username and password to the VM!!
### This is running in my AWS account, so please don't share with anyone outside this class.
### We're using a common VM login, be mindful of not deleting other peoples' stuff.
### Steps:
### Follow the steps in the document attached to this assignement.
